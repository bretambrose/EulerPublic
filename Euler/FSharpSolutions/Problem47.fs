        The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

        14 = 2 * 7
        15 = 3 * 5

        The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

        644 = 2² * 7 * 23
        645 = 3 * 5 * 43
        646 = 2 * 17 * 19.

        Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct primes factors. What is the first of these numbers?
