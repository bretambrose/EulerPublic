        In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

        1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
        It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

        1 x £1 + 1 x 50p + 2 x 20p + 1 x 5p + 1 x 2p + 3 x 1p

        How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
