        It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

        9 = 7 + 2 * 1^2
        15 = 7 + 2 * 2^2
        21 = 3 + 2 * 3^2
        25 = 7 + 2 * 3^2
        27 = 19 + 2 * 2^2
        33 = 31 + 2 * 1^2

        It turns out that the conjecture was false.

        What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
